# Learn Page Chatbot Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a chatbot feature to the Learn page, utilizing the pre-existing ChatModal component with an educational prompt and Lincoln Financial resources.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/lib/chat.ts`
- Added `askFinMate` export as an alias for `askLifeLens`
- This ensures compatibility with the ChatModal component that was already using `askFinMate`

### 2. `src/lib/types.ts`
- Added `"learn"` to the `ScreenKey` type union
- This enables proper TypeScript typing for the learn screen navigation

### 3. `src/app/page.tsx`
- Imported `LearningHub` component
- Added learn screen to the navigation visible screens array
- Added learn screen rendering with AnimatePresence and motion animations
- Removed unused `setChatHistory` call from `handleClearAllData`

### 4. `src/components/learning-hub.tsx`
- Added AI chatbot integration section with "Ask FinMate" heading
- Implemented `handleOpenChat` function that dispatches a custom event to open the chatbot
- Pre-loaded educational prompt: "I'd like to learn more about my benefits and financial planning options. Can you help me understand what resources are available to me?"
- Added Lincoln Financial Resources section with 4 key resource links:
  - Life Insurance Guide (https://www.lfg.com/public/individual/lifeinsurance)
  - Retirement Planning Tools (https://www.lfg.com/public/individual/retirement)
  - Financial Wellness Center (https://www.lfg.com/public/individual/financialwellness)
  - Education Planning (https://www.lfg.com/public/individual/education)
- Maintained all existing functionality (search, categories, recommended articles)
- Used consistent UI/UX with existing theme colors and styling

## How the Chatbot Integration Works

1. **Event-Based Communication**: The learning hub component dispatches a custom event `FinMate:chat:open` when the user clicks "Start Learning with AI"
2. **Pre-typed Prompt**: The event includes a detail object with the educational prompt and context
3. **Existing ChatModal**: The ChatModal component (already present in the app) listens for this event and opens with the pre-typed prompt
4. **User Control**: Users can delete, modify, or send the pre-typed prompt as-is

## UI/UX Consistency

- Uses existing LifeLens color palette:
  - Primary: #A41E34
  - Background: #F7F4F2
  - Text: #2A1A1A, #6F4D51
  - Borders: #E6D7D9
- Follows existing card and button styling patterns
- Matches navigation structure from other screens (FAQ, Timeline, Profile)
- Maintains responsive design principles

## Testing

- CodeQL security analysis: ✅ No vulnerabilities found
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ No new errors introduced (existing errors are pre-existing issues in the codebase)
- UI rendering: ✅ Verified through demo visualization

## Future Enhancements (Not in Scope)

- Fix pre-existing TypeScript errors in DynamicQuiz.tsx
- Add actual article content/links instead of placeholders
- Implement article search functionality with backend integration
- Add user progress tracking for completed articles
